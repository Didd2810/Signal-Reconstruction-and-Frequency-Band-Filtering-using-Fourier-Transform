# Signal-Reconstruction-and-Frequency-Band-Filtering-using-Fourier-Transform
## Abstract
This program demonstrates the use of Fourier Transform to analyze, filter, and reconstruct audio signals by selectively isolating frequency components. The input signal is decomposed into its frequency spectrum using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). Specific bandwidths (0–500 Hz, 0–1500 Hz, 0–2500 Hz) are filtered to examine the effects of removing higher-frequency components. The signals are reconstructed using the Inverse Fourier Transform and saved as .wav files for further analysis. This process highlights the relationship between time-domain and frequency-domain representations of signals.
